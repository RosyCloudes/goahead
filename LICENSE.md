## Evaluation Use

An evaluation license is offered that provides a limited, evaluation license for internal and non-commercial use. See the [EVAL.md](./EVAL.md) license for details.

With a paid-up subscription you can incorporate new releases, updates and patches for the software into your products. If you do not have an active subscription, you cannot apply patches from the software to your products.


## GoAhead 2.X License

GoAhead version 2.X is obsolete.  If you are using version 2, you cannot apply code or patches from the GoAhead version 4+ code base as the GoAhead 2.X license is incompatible. You must adopt a commercial license for GoAhead version 4+. You cannot extract patches from this repository and apply to GoAhead 2 code.

While the GoAhead 3/4+ APIs are different in syntax, the underlying functionality is the same, the upgrade to version 4+ is quite easy.
